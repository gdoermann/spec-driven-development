# Database Backup Automation

## Quick Summary
Implement automated daily database backups with 30-day retention, point-in-time recovery capability, and automated testing of backup integrity.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Manual database backups are error-prone and inconsistent, creating risk of data loss and extended recovery times during incidents.

### Users Affected
- **Primary**: All users (data protection)
- **Secondary**: Operations team (reduced manual work)

### Success Metrics
- [x] Zero missed daily backups
- [x] Backup restoration under 30 minutes
- [x] 30-day backup history maintained
- [x] Monthly restore tests passing

### Business Value
- Reduced data loss risk from days to hours
- 90% reduction in manual backup tasks
- Compliance with data protection requirements
- Estimated $50k/year saved in potential downtime

## Technical Specification

### Dependencies
- **Blocks**: None
- **Blocked By**: None
- **Enhances**: Disaster Recovery Plan
- **Enhanced By**: None

### System Changes

#### Database
- **New Tables**: 
  - `backup_history` - Track backup jobs
- **Modified Tables**: None
- **Migrations Required**: Yes, simple

#### API
- **New Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /api/v1/admin/backups` - List backups
  - `POST /api/v1/admin/backups/test` - Test restore
- **Modified Endpoints**: None
- **Breaking Changes**: No

#### Frontend
- **New Components**: 
  - BackupStatus - Admin dashboard widget
- **Modified Components**: 
  - AdminDashboard - Add backup status
- **New Routes**: 
  - `/admin/backups` - Backup management

### Technical Constraints
- Backups must not impact production performance
- Must support point-in-time recovery
- Storage costs under $100/month
- Encryption at rest required

### Architecture Decisions
- **Approach**: pg_dump with S3 storage and lifecycle rules
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - Continuous archiving: Too complex for needs
  - Managed backup service: Too expensive
- **Trade-offs**: Simple solution vs advanced features

## Rollout Strategy

### Deployment Approach ✅
- **Type**: Gradual rollout
- **Rollback Plan**: Disable cron, keep manual process

### Communication ✅
- **Internal**: Ops team training completed
- **External**: Status page updated

### Monitoring ✅
- **Metrics Tracked**: 
  - Backup success rate: 100%
  - Backup duration: ~12 minutes
  - Storage used: 2.3GB/month
- **Alerts Configured**: 
  - Failed backup
  - Backup >30 minutes
  - Restore test failure

## Notes

### Implementation Notes
- pg_dump compression reduced backup size by 85%
- Added parallel dump for 3x speed improvement
- S3 transfer acceleration worth the extra cost
- Checksum verification caught one corruption

### Patterns Extracted
- Retry pattern added to PATTERNS.md
- S3 lifecycle management pattern documented
- Monitoring pattern for scheduled jobs

### Lessons Learned
- Test restore process more critical than backup
- Parallel dumps require careful connection management
- CloudWatch Logs Insights great for backup analysis
- Monthly restore tests caught edge case early
