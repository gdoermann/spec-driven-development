## Example Decisions

## 2024-01-15: Database Choice - PostgreSQL
- **Context**: Starting new project, need to select primary database
- **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as primary database
- **Alternatives Considered**: 
  - MySQL: Less feature-rich
  - MongoDB: No ACID guarantees needed for NoSQL
  - SQLite: Not suitable for production scale
- **Rationale**: 
  - Strong JSON support for flexible schemas
  - Full ACID compliance
  - Excellent performance at scale
  - Rich ecosystem and tooling
- **Trade-offs**: 
  - Gained: Reliability, features, scalability
  - Lost: Simplicity of NoSQL for some use cases
- **Revisit When**: Never - foundational choice

## 2024-01-20: Authentication Strategy - JWT with Refresh Tokens
- **Context**: Need secure, scalable authentication system
- **Decision**: Implement JWT access tokens with separate refresh tokens
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Session-based: Requires sticky sessions, harder to scale
  - Simple JWT: No way to revoke tokens
  - OAuth only: Overkill for internal users
- **Rationale**:
  - Stateless authentication for easy scaling
  - Refresh tokens allow revocation
  - Works well with mobile apps and SPAs
  - Industry standard approach
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Scalability, mobile support, standards compliance
  - Lost: Simplicity, slight complexity in token refresh
- **Revisit When**: If moving to microservices (consider service mesh auth)

## 2024-01-25: API Versioning - URL Path Versioning
- **Context**: API will evolve, need versioning strategy
- **Decision**: Version in URL path (e.g., /api/v1/users)
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Header versioning: Less discoverable
  - Query parameter: Can be accidentally omitted
  - No versioning: Would break clients
- **Rationale**:
  - Most explicit and clear
  - Easy to route at load balancer
  - Clear in logs and debugging
  - RESTful standard
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Clarity, ease of use, infrastructure support
  - Lost: Flexibility of header versioning
- **Revisit When**: If adopting GraphQL or gRPC

## 2024-02-01: State Management - Context + Reducer
- **Context**: Need state management for React app
- **Decision**: Use React Context with useReducer for state management
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Redux: Overkill for current app size
  - MobX: Team unfamiliar with observables
  - Zustand: Less mature, smaller community
- **Rationale**:
  - Built into React, no extra dependencies
  - Sufficient for current complexity
  - Team already familiar with pattern
  - Easy to migrate to Redux later if needed
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Simplicity, no dependencies, familiar patterns
  - Lost: Redux DevTools, middleware ecosystem
- **Revisit When**: If app grows beyond 50 components or needs time-travel debugging

## 2024-02-10: Testing Strategy - Testing Library + Vitest
- **Context**: Need testing framework for React application
- **Decision**: Use Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Jest: Slower, more configuration needed
  - Cypress component tests: Heavier, slower
  - Enzyme: Deprecated, encourages testing implementation
- **Rationale**:
  - Vitest is fast and Jest-compatible
  - Testing Library encourages testing user behavior
  - Great TypeScript support
  - Active development and community
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Speed, modern tooling, good practices
  - Lost: Some Jest ecosystem tools
- **Revisit When**: If Vitest development stalls or major breaking changes

## 2024-02-15: Error Tracking - Structured Logging
- **Context**: Need to track and debug production errors
- **Decision**: Use structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Sentry: Cost for small team
  - Simple console logs: Not searchable
  - ELK stack: Operational overhead
- **Rationale**:
  - Can use any log aggregation service
  - Structured data enables powerful queries
  - Correlation IDs trace requests across services
  - No vendor lock-in
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Flexibility, no costs, powerful querying
  - Lost: Built-in error grouping and alerting
- **Revisit When**: If error volume justifies dedicated error tracking service

## 2024-02-20: File Upload - Direct to S3
- **Context**: Need to handle large file uploads efficiently
- **Decision**: Upload directly to S3 using presigned URLs
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Through API server: Would bottleneck server
  - Separate upload service: Additional complexity
  - CDN upload: More expensive for storage
- **Rationale**:
  - Removes load from application servers
  - S3 handles all the complexity
  - Cost-effective for storage
  - Can add CDN later for delivery
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Scalability, reduced server load, cost efficiency
  - Lost: Less control over upload process
- **Revisit When**: If need real-time processing during upload

## 2024-03-01: Code Formatting - Prettier with Default Config
- **Context**: Need consistent code formatting across team
- **Decision**: Use Prettier with default configuration
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - ESLint only: More configuration, less opinionated
  - Custom Prettier config: Bikeshedding risk
  - No formatter: Inconsistent code
- **Rationale**:
  - Zero configuration to maintain
  - Industry standard defaults
  - Ends formatting debates
  - Works with all editors
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Consistency, no debates, simplicity
  - Lost: Some team preferences
- **Revisit When**: Never - formatting consistency more important than preferences

## 2024-03-10: Deployment Strategy - Blue-Green Deployments
- **Context**: Need zero-downtime deployments
- **Decision**: Implement blue-green deployment pattern
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Rolling updates: More complex rollback
  - Canary: Overkill for current scale
  - Direct replacement: Causes downtime
- **Rationale**:
  - Instant rollback capability
  - Zero downtime
  - Simple to understand and implement
  - Tests full production environment
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Safety, simplicity, zero downtime
  - Lost: Double infrastructure cost during deployment
- **Revisit When**: If need more granular rollout control

## 2024-03-15: Background Jobs - Database Queue
- **Context**: Need to process background jobs reliably
- **Decision**: Use PostgreSQL as job queue with row locking
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Redis Queue: Another service to manage
  - SQS: AWS lock-in
  - Kafka: Overkill for current needs
- **Rationale**:
  - No additional infrastructure
  - ACID guarantees for job processing
  - Can leverage existing DB knowledge
  - Good enough for current scale
- **Trade-offs**:
  - Gained: Simplicity, reliability, no new dependencies
  - Lost: Purpose-built queue features
- **Revisit When**: If exceeding 1000 jobs/minute

## Decision Criteria

When making architectural decisions, consider:

1. **Simplicity**: Is this the simplest solution that could work?
2. **Team Knowledge**: Does the team know this technology?
3. **Maintenance Burden**: How much ongoing work does this create?
4. **Flexibility**: How hard is it to change later?
5. **Cost**: What are the financial implications?
6. **Scale**: Will this work at 10x current load?
7. **Security**: Does this introduce security risks?
8. **Standards**: Is this an industry standard approach?

## Revisiting Decisions

Decisions should be revisited when:
- The context significantly changes
- The "Revisit When" conditions are met
- New technology makes alternatives much better
- The decision is causing repeated problems
- Scale has increased beyond original assumptions

Remember: The goal is to make decisions that are good enough and move forward, not to find the perfect solution.
